## Project Status:

Completed.

## Project Description

The aim of this project is to predict the price of new diamonds.

This prediction was accomplished through a data exploration analysis, using linear regression concepts based on historical diamond prices.

The site returns the RMSE (root mean squared error) that means how much it represented in dollars. And the final goal is to have an RMSE lower than 900 dollars.

## Conclusion

It was conclued that:

- price and carat variables don't have a linear relation between them, but a logarithmic relationship instead.

- diamonds must be separeted by category (used variable: clarity).
